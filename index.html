  <h2>Adding Articles</h2>
  <p>
    You can add new articles to Snipp in two simple ways. First, tap the <strong>+</strong> button located at the top right corner of the app to manually add an article. Alternatively, the easiest way is to use the <strong>Share</strong> button on your phone from any other app — such as your browser, social media apps, or news sources — and select Snipp from the share options. This lets you save interesting content instantly without leaving your current app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plus, Snipp automatically detects when you copy a URL to your clipboard and will prompt you to add it to your saved articles—no extra steps needed!
